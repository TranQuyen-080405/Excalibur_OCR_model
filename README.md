# Excalibur_OCR
# OCR Classification & Recognition System

This repository contains the complete Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline, designed to analyze the document type and apply the optimal OCR engine.

##  Key Components

1.  **Classification Model** – A TensorFlow/Keras-based deep learning model used to identify the image type and determine which OCR engine to invoke.
2.  **OCR Models** – Including **PaddleOCR** and **NanoNet** (referred to as VLM), used for text extraction and post-processing.

## Environment Requirements

| Component | Python Version | Notes |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| `classification` (image classifier) | **Python 3.10** | Uses the Keras-based model (`keras_model.h5`). |
| `ocr modules` (PaddleOCR, NanoNet) | **Python 3.13** | Uses PaddleOCR, OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, etc. |

> ⚠️ **Recommendation:** It is highly recommended to create **two separate virtual environments** to avoid dependency conflicts (e.g., `excalibur-class` for 3.10 and `excalibur-ocr` for 3.13).

## Image Path Configuration

Make sure to define your **image paths** properly in your scripts.

```python
# Example (for PaddleOCR or NanoNet)
img_path = r"D:\Classification\images\sample.jpg"
txt_dir  = r"D:\Classification\results"

## How to Run

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook or VSCode Notebook interface.**  
2. **Run notebooks in order** as listed below:

   1️: `classification.ipynb`  
   → Classifies the document and decides which OCR model should be used.  
   Output: saves classification results inside `results/classification/`.

   2️: `Paddle.ipynb`  
   → Performs OCR using PaddleOCR model.  
   Output: saves text results and processed images to `results/paddle/`.

   3️: `VLM.ipynb`  
   → Performs OCR using Nanonet model.  
   Output: saves text results and processed images to `results/nanonet/`..
